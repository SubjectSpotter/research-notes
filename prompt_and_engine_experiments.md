That's fantastic!  I'd like you to try something a little more complex: there is a JSON file with a list of entities which may appear in the text at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SubjectSpotter/sample-documents/refs/heads/main/all_subjects.json.

Please read the list of entities, and consider the ID, title, description and categorization of each entity.  Then read the text and use HTML mark-up to tag each entity within the text.  Use anchor tags to surround the text mentioning an entity, adding the ID of the entity in the ID attribute of the tag, and the title of the entity in the title attribute of the tag.
